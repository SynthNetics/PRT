# PRT - Parallel Routing Table

entered into "The Great Cross-Architecture Challenge" on CodeProject 

it is a new oneAPI application being developed on the Intel DevCloud

the concept is to facilitate parallel search 
through a table of Routing keys 

such as looking through a tabular list of internet domains,  
so as to obtain an indexed reference key 
into the corresponding list of IP addresses

the entire Parallel Routing Table concept is generic enough 
so as to facilitate other applications, 
such as searching through tabular AIML lists 
for finding natural language responses 
to listings based upon heuristic conversation rules

although I'm not a biologist, 
perhaps there might also be usefulness 
in parallel searching though genetic sequences

this first stage challenge entry implementation 
only implements searches for direct matches of key value strings

future development, perhaps open source team efforts, 
might develope "nearest match" algorithms

I've never claimed to be a good speller, 

ever have someone tell you to 
"look it up in the dictionary"

which of course requires you to know the spelling to find it

which can get quite complicated,  
especially if french language vowel combinations are involved

and some words are pronounced quite differently 
from how they are actually spelled.

for example the "f" sound spelled "ph" in telephone

now-a-days kids grow up with word processors with "spell check"

the concept might be useful for reference key searches.

I don't know what research search engine companies are doing in this field, 
this is my attempt to try to develope something useful.

who knows, perhaps in the world of the future 
biologist might develope comprehesion of the
implications of "close matches" in DNA sequencing



my continuing efforts to develope this concept 
are further expressed in my "PRV" Parallel Routiung Vector conceptualizations:
